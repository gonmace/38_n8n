  Django projects — including creating models, writing views, building DRF APIs,
  designing URL patterns, writing tests, configuring settings, handling migrations,
  or reviewing Django code for correctness and performance. Also trigger for
  questions about ORM queries, N+1 problems, select_related/prefetch_related,
  authentication, permissions, middleware, signals, caching, Celery tasks,
  deployment, Docker, or Django project structure. If the task involves any
  Django or Django REST Framework code, activate this skill immediately.

# Django Best Practices

A senior Django developer's knowledge base covering 27 topics — from ORM queries to deployment. This skill provides wrong vs correct code examples and architectural guidance for building production-grade Django applications.

## When to use this skill

- Creating or modifying Django models, fields, or relations
- Writing views (FBV, CBV, or DRF ViewSets)
- Building or updating DRF serializers and API endpoints
- Writing ORM queries, fixing N+1 problems, or optimizing performance
- Creating or reviewing migrations
- Configuring Django settings, middleware, or URL routing
- Implementing authentication, permissions, or session management
- Setting up caching (Redis, Memcached, per-view, fragment)
- Writing or reviewing tests (Django TestCase, pytest, factories)
- Working with Django signals, forms, templates, or template tags
- Configuring static/media files, file uploads, or storage backends
- Setting up Celery tasks, periodic tasks, or background jobs
- Deploying Django (Gunicorn, Nginx, Docker, CI/CD)
- Working with Django Channels or WebSockets
- Implementing i18n/l10n or timezone support
- Reviewing code for security issues (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection)
- Designing app architecture, service layers, or project structure

## Workflow

When this skill is activated, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the topic** — Determine which area of Django the task involves (models, views, queries, etc.)
2. **Read the relevant reference file** — Consult the reference table below and read the appropriate file before writing any code
3. **Apply the correct patterns** — Follow the "Correct" patterns from the reference file, avoid the "Wrong" anti-patterns
4. **Check for common mistakes** — Review the "Why" explanations to understand the reasoning behind each pattern
5. **Cross-reference related topics** — If the task spans multiple areas (e.g., views + queries + templates), read all relevant reference files

> Always read the relevant reference file before writing code for that topic.

## Key Principles

### Project Structure
- Separate config from apps. Use `config/settings/` with base, local, and production files.
- Keep apps small and focused (3-8 models per app). Split when an app exceeds 15 models.
- Always set `AUTH_USER_MODEL` before the first migration.
- Reference users via `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`, never `auth.User` directly.

### Models & ORM
- Use `DecimalField` for money, `BooleanField` for flags, `EmailField` for emails.
- Always set explicit `related_name` on ForeignKey and OneToOneField.
- Use `select_related` for ForeignKey/OneToOne, `prefetch_related` for ManyToMany/reverse FK.
- Use `F()` expressions for atomic updates to avoid race conditions.
- Use `Exists()` instead of `.count() > 0` for existence checks.
- Use `bulk_create` and `bulk_update` for batch operations.
- Wrap multi-step writes in `transaction.atomic()`.

### Queries
- Never filter in Python when the database can do it.
- Use `Q` objects for OR/NOT queries.
- Use `annotate` with `Subquery` instead of N+1 loops.
- Always parameterize raw SQL — never use f-strings.
- Use `.values_list()` when you don't need full model instances.
- Use `.exists()` instead of `.count() > 0`.
- Use `.iterator()` for large querysets.

### Views
- Use FBVs for simple one-off views, CBVs for CRUD with generics.
- Always use `LoginRequiredMixin` or `@login_required` for protected views.
- Override `get_queryset()` to enforce ownership in UpdateView/DeleteView.
- Use `get_object_or_404` in views, `.first()` when absence is expected.

### Forms & Validation
- Always use explicit `fields` in ModelForm — never `exclude` or `__all__`.
- Use `clean_<field>()` for single-field validation, `clean()` for cross-field.
- Use Django's built-in validators and write custom ones for domain rules.

### Security
- Never disable CSRF except for external webhooks with their own auth.
- Never use `mark_safe()` or `|safe` on user input — use `format_html()`.
- Never use f-strings in raw SQL — always parameterize.
- Use Argon2 for password hashing, PBKDF2 as fallback.
- Set `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`, `SECURE_HSTS_*`, and cookie security flags in production.
- Run `manage.py check --deploy` before every deployment.

### Admin
- Always configure `list_display`, `list_filter`, and `search_fields`.
- Use `list_select_related` to prevent N+1 queries in list views.
- Use `readonly_fields` for computed/automatic values.
- Override permission methods to restrict what staff can do.

### Templates
- Use template inheritance with `base.html` and `{% block %}` tags.
- Always use `{% url %}` and `{% static %}` — never hardcode paths.
- Use `{% empty %}` in for loops and `{% with %}` for expensive lookups.
- Never use `{% autoescape off %}` or `|safe` on user content.

### Migrations
- Make small, focused migrations with descriptive names.
- Always provide reverse operations for custom/data migrations.
- Use `apps.get_model()` in data migrations, never direct model imports.
- Multi-step approach for column removal: make nullable → deploy → remove.
- Use `--plan` to preview migrations before running in production.

### Testing
- Use `SimpleTestCase` for no-DB tests, `TestCase` for DB tests.
- Use `setUpTestData` for class-level test data (faster than `setUp`).
- Use factory_boy instead of JSON fixtures.
- Mock external services (SMS, payments, APIs).
- Use `@override_settings` and Django's `locmem` email backend for testing.
- Aim for 80%+ coverage on business logic.

### DRF
- Always use explicit `fields` in serializers — never `__all__`.
- Use separate read/write serializers for nested data.
- Set `IsAuthenticated` as the global default permission.
- Always paginate list endpoints.
- Use `django-filter` for declarative filtering.
- Optimize `get_queryset()` with `select_related`/`prefetch_related`.

### Signals
- Import signals in `AppConfig.ready()`, never at module level.
- Use `dispatch_uid` to prevent duplicate connections.
- Prefer explicit method calls over signals for tightly coupled logic.
- Use signals only for decoupled cross-app communication.

### Caching
- Use `DummyCache` in development, Redis in production.
- Use namespaced cache keys with timeouts.
- Invalidate targeted keys, never `cache.clear()`.
- Cache at the most granular level that makes sense.

### Deployment
- Never use `runserver` in production — use Gunicorn or Uvicorn.
- Use multi-stage Docker builds.
- Store secrets in environment variables, never in code.
- Use zero-downtime deployment with Gunicorn HUP signal.
- Always have a health check endpoint.

### Background Tasks
- Pass IDs to tasks, never model instances.
- Always implement retry logic with exponential backoff.
- Make tasks idempotent — safe to run more than once.
- Use `@shared_task` instead of importing the Celery app directly.
